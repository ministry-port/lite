## Developed for WordPress 5.0+
Lite has been designed and developed for WordPress 5.0+. If you are having issues activating Lite, be sure to have the latest version of WordPress installed on your server.

## Setting up the homepage and blog page
Simply publish a post and be sure to set a featured image. If no image is set, a background color will be used instead.

## Setting up your main navigation and social navigation
Lite supports 2 menu locations. Your Primary menu and Social Links menu. In your WordPress Dashboard, go to Appearance > Menus. From here you can create the menus and choose the theme location for each menu.

## Social Links Setup
To setup your social links menu. Go to Appearance > Menus. Create a new menu Name it social. Check 'Social' under theme location. Finally, add custom links to your menu. Be sure to click the 'Save Menu' button to save your menu. Lite supports most social networks. If we are missing one, you can request new items at https://ministryport.com/support.

## Footer Widgets
To setup the widgets in the footer as seen in our live demo: https://ministryport.com/Lite-demo/ Go to Appearance > Widgets and you'll see the 'Sidebar' module to add your widgets. The main demo is using 3 text widgets. For best results, we suggest using 3 widgets at most.

## Editing Lite
If you would like to edit the footer credit, this is allowed, however, we would highly appreciate keeping some form of theme credit linking back to https://ministryport.com/. With Lite Pro, you can edit the footer credit under your theme options in the Customizer if you are signed into your WordPress dashboard. From the main dashboard, go to Appearance > Customize > Lite Theme Options.

If you need of a free text editor, we recommend Atom by GitHub:
https://atom.io/

For updating any styles, Lite uses plain CSS to help keep things simple. We highly recommend adding or modifying any styles by using the built in 'Additional CSS' module that is located under 'Appearance' > 'Customize' > 'Additional CSS'. You can find this in your WordPress dashboard. Adding CSS via the 'Additional CSS' module will prevent any loss of changes when we update Lite. If you do not see the 'Additional CSS' module under 'Customize' you may need to update your WordPress install to the latest version.
